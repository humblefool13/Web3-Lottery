**THIS IS AN EDUCATIONAL PROJECT.**
**Please do not use in production.**

## Features:
- Deploys a child contract which stores the owner's profit and allows withdrawal when wanted by the owner.
- Buy tickets with price fixed in USD. Any extra amount sent is stored as a tip which is withdrawable later.
- ChainLink VRF is used to determine the winners.
- Withdraw any extra $LINK on the contract.
- 5% of funds stay in contract ( more of like a storage/treasury )
- Also has a RUG function ( just for fun/education kek ) **real purpose:** To just pull out all test ETH and test $LINK if I wanted to make any changes and redeploy the contract.
